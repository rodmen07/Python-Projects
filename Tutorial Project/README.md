This project is built from tutorial for setting up a basic Python/Flask app:
https://pythonistaplanet.com/flask/

To run this file:
1) Install Flask if necessary:
```bash
    pip install flask
```
2) Set FLASK_APP to 'hello.py' and FLASK_ENV to 'development' (use set instead of export for Windows OS)
```bash
    export FLASK_APP=hello.py
    export FLASK_ENV=development
```
3) Run the Flask app:
```bash
    flask run
```
